# project-orbs
## Introduction
Orbs is a game that I did as a first solo project in week 6 of Ironhack!

It is based on the game [Agar.io](https://www.agar.io/), but you play against the computer instead of playing against other players.

This project allowed me to explore some cool concepts such as svg filters, simulating camera movements on Canvas, collision detection, following the mouse at different velocities, and [autonomous agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_xJMH8VvAE&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain).
